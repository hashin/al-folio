`A melancholy-looking man, he had the appearance of one who has searched for the leak in life's gas-pipe with a lighted candle.`  
`~ P.G Wodehouse.`

I am into books, travel, debates and a bit of tech. I write about a lot of irrelevant stuff, though I am convinced of their utility when I write them. Sort of an existentialist, but I don't concur with the idea that existence is pain. Purpose of existence may be void, but we sure can infuse meaning by actively seeking self determination.
